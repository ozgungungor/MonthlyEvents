Privacy Policy

Last Updated: July 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains the information collected from users of the Paynify (“Application”), developed by Ozgun Gungor (“we,” “us,” or “our”), and how this information is used.

1. Information We Collect

When you use our Application, there are two types of information involved:

a) Information You Provide
To perform its core functions, the Application processes the payment information you enter (such as card name, due date, installment details, etc.). This information is necessary for the Application to function.

IMPORTANT: All financial data you enter is stored only on your device locally. This data is never sent to our servers or any third-party servers, and is not seen or collected by us. You have complete control over your data.

b) Information Automatically Collected by Third-Party Advertising Partners
Our Application uses a service called AdMob, provided by Google, to display ads in order to offer our service for free. AdMob may automatically collect certain data to provide you with more relevant and personalized ads. This data may include:

Identifiers: Such as your device’s advertising ID (IDFA).

Usage Data: Such as your interactions with ads.

Diagnostics: Such as app crash data.

Approximate Location: To serve geographically targeted ads.

For more information on how Google uses data, please visit Google’s Advertising Technology Policy.

2. How We Use Your Information

Information You Provide: Used solely on your device to provide the Application’s core functions (payment tracking, reminders, etc.).

Automatically Collected Information: Used by our third-party advertising partner (Google AdMob) to deliver interest-based ads, measure ad campaign effectiveness, and improve their services.

3. App Tracking Transparency

On iOS 14.5 and later, in accordance with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework, we will request your permission to track you for advertising purposes. This permission allows our advertising partner to deliver more personalized ads. If you choose not to grant permission, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant to your interests.

4. Data Security

Storing your personal financial data only on your device significantly enhances its security. The security of automatically collected data is the responsibility of our third-party partner (Google).

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically for updates.
