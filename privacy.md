Privacy Policy
Last Updated: August 14, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains the information collected from users of the Paynify (“Application”), developed by Ozgun Gungor (“we,” “us,” or “our”), and how this information is used.

1. Information We Collect

When you use our Application, there are two types of information involved:

a) Information You Provide
To perform its core functions, the Application processes the payment information you enter (such as card name, due date, installment details, etc.). This information is necessary for the Application to function.

IMPORTANT: All financial data you enter is stored only on your device locally. This data is never sent to our servers or any third-party servers, and is not seen or collected by us. You have complete control over your data.

b) Information Automatically Collected by Third-Party Advertising Partners
Our Application uses a service called AdMob, provided by Google, to display ads in order to offer our service for free. We have configured AdMob to show non-personalized ads only, meaning that the ads are not based on your activity across other apps or websites, and no tracking occurs. AdMob may still automatically collect certain basic data necessary for delivering ads, such as:

General diagnostics (e.g., crash reports)

Basic usage statistics within the app

Approximate location (e.g., country or region) for language or regional relevance

For more information on how Google handles ad delivery without personalized tracking, please visit Google’s Advertising Technology Policy.

2. How We Use Your Information

Information You Provide: Used solely on your device to provide the Application’s core functions (payment tracking, reminders, etc.).

Automatically Collected Information: Used by Google AdMob strictly for delivering non-personalized ads and ensuring ad functionality.

3. Data Security

Storing your personal financial data only on your device significantly enhances its security. The security of automatically collected data is the responsibility of our third-party partner (Google).

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically for updates.
